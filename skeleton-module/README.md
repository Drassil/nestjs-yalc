# skeleton-module

This skeleton module contains examples of how to create CRUD operations on 2 different mysql tables that are in relationship: `User` and `Phone`

- `Phone` : it is composed by an example of how to create CRUD operation on a entity with the bare-minimum configuration possible (No authorization, extra methods etc.)
- `User` : the user instead is a more complete example with many configurations to show the most important options and features available on `nestjs-yalc/crud-gen`.
